			<hr class="work-hr">
			<p>I joined a small Italian team, based in Rome and London to work on designing this concept. For this ambitious project I worked closely with a
			number of back-end developers and project managers. I was introduced to Ruby and took part in front-end development. We mostly worked together on Github
		as version control was important in working together well in this case.</p>
		<p>I worked closely in building a front-end structure, working with Sass and Slim on Ruby on Rails. You may find my blog post on building CSS Architectures  <a href="https://medium.com/@Kristinaolivia/some-points-on-css-architecture-8d3b0ca3b8c3#.55fmvi6d7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<p>I wanted to incorporate some illustration as well, to give the whole brand a more playful feel. For this I just made some simple
			drawings in illustrator and traced fonts so it would incorporat nicely with the style, as in the little gif above. </p>
			<p>The story here was about travel and inspiration - inspiring people to visit other places..</p>

			<p>This project required a dashboard design, as it was designed to hold a lot of customer data. The idea was to deliver something very lightweight
			and easy to use and understand, but at the same time allowing the user to be exited by it and encourage them to build their profile.</p>

			<p>I worked on branding the product as well. We chose a yellow and blue colour scheme purely on the idea that the product itself should incite
			feelings of happyness for the user. The G in the logo reflects the idea of being available 'around the world', hence its round and swirly pattern. Out og about 23 other
		ideas we decided to go with this one, as it reflected the idea of the brand the best and incorporated the first letter of the brand name, as requested by the CEO.</p>
		<p>There were myriads of wireframes and layouts that brought to the final idea eventually. Some are displayed above.</p>
		<p>All of this project was designed and built to accomodate responsive needs, working with media queries in this instance, using the Neat framework and Susy grid.</p>

			<p>Above are some examples of the overall style of the site - simple and lightweight. I worked with spacing a lot to make sure nothing was crammed together
			and the information in the design was easily accessable at first glance.</p>
