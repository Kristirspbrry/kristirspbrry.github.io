			<h2 class="medium-title">Building a digital brand</h2>
			<p class="p-main"> The Idle Man was one of the first start-ups to exclusively focus on menswear and men's grooming. The aim of our team was to build an appealing brand to our audience.  </p>
			<p class="p-main">I worked closely with the team to come up with our branding by determining and researching our potential target market and audience. </p>
      <p class="p-main">The Brand Story revolved around keeping it clean and fresh and bold, as we found that was what our audience found appealing. </p>

    <div class="full-width-img center"><img src="img/idle-h2.jpg" alt="img"></div>
    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
		<p class="p-main">The Idle Man was created as a platform to explore and share ideas and news in menswear, so connecting and getting our audience involved was important to be part of that culture.</p>

    <div class="full-width-img"><img src="img/idle-h-3.jpg" alt="img"></div>
    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
			<p class="p-main"> Our digital presence needed to reflect the aforementioned values, but I also focused a lot on usability and accessibility for the responsive website. </p>
			<p class="p-main">We wanted to avoid hiding the most valuable sections of the site in the hamburger menu based on our user research and opted for a more accessible list on mobile.</p>

    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
			<p class="p-main">Another focus of this brand was with fashion styling and The Idle Man required a sort of style guide for the user. Working closely with the Marketing
			Director and the style editor, we came up with a style guide questionnaire to also help us understand our audience. I designed and built a form that allowed the user to let the stylist know what
		the user likes. This information was used then for the stylist to select a brand new wardrobe for the user. This data was sent out via email, where the user
	could buy the outfit directly or just a few pieces. It proved to be successful and helped in generating data on what sort of audience the site was attracting.</p>

    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
			<p class="p-main"> As this was a start-up and a brand new product we have given ourselves time to experiment with different MVPs. We initially designed for a festival type audience, but after running some tests our results were not what we were aiming for so we went back to the drawing board to ask the questions about what our audience really cares about. </p>

			<p class="p-main"> During my time at The Idle Man, the product had evolved and changed considerably from the initial ideas we had, which was based on our users' feedback and engagement.  </p>
