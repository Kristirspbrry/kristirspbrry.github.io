			<h2 class="medium-title">The Idle Man</h2>
			<p class="p-intro">A menswear online retailer</p>
			<hr class="work-hr">
			<p>For this meanswear start-up I worked on general Art Direction, logo and identity design as well as some print and packaging design.
        My main focus was on the digital - working on designing and building (together with the back end developer) a responsive and a mobile
        site, as well as digital advertising.</p>
        <p>The story here was to keep it clean and fresh, bold. I used a lot of black and white and the branding was quite neutral to place emphasis
        on the clothing.</p>

    <div class="full-width-img idle-bg-color center"><img src="img/idle-h-2.jpg" alt="img"></div>
    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
      <p>I worked with wireframing and designing the layout of the website as well as the logo and brand identity. The graphics followed the aforementioned
			bold and clean approach, reflected in the illustrated sections of the design. </p>
			<p>CEO's idea behind The Idle Man name came from the saying 'idle hands' (meaning that most guys don't really like shopping so much),
		 hence the logo with a hand graphic. It was also a platform for a community for guys to learn and follow style trends, so the logo incorporates this
	 idea with several hands connecting together.</p>

    <div class="full-width-img"><img src="img/idle-h-3.jpg" alt="img"></div>
    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
      <p>My main focus while working on this project was making the website resposive across desktop, tablet and mobile. I worked with making the layout
			reflect this need by dividing the site into sections. </p>
			<p>For mobile, some sections were greatly reduced, as we found that it was easier to present the
		user with what they came to the site to do - shop clothes or check out style news. I worked on a design to make that easily accessible, and so, I found that
	placing it all in the hamburger menu wouldn't work as well as having the links readily available to user on the landing page. Hence, the mobile version was a simple
design with several buttons that linked the user to the key points of the brand. The rest was of course easily available in the side menu.</p>

    <div class="full-width-img"><img src="img/idle-h-6.jpg" alt="img"></div>
    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
      <p>Another focus of this brand was with fashion styling and The Idle Man required a sort of style guide for the user. Working closely with the Marketing
			Director and the style editor, we came up with a style guide questionaire. I designed and built a form that allowed the user to let the stylist know what
		the user likes. This information was used then for the stylist to select a brand new wardrobe for the user. This data was sent out via email, whenere the user
	could buy the outfit directly or just a few pieces. It proved to be successful and helped in generating data on what sort of audience the site was attracting.</p>

    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
      <p>I also made sure that all artwork across social media was on brand, coming up with templates and style guides.</p>

    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
      <p>The Idle Man was build on Magento and I worked with the back-end PHP developer quite closely to integrate all my Front-end code and designs.</p>
