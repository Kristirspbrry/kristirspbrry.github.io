			<h2 class="medium-title">The Idle Man</h2>
			<p class="p-main">When I joined The Idle Man on this project, they were taking their very first steps as a start-up. As a sole designer I took on the all rounder role of an Art Director, working on their identity and logo design as well the website.</p>
			<p class="p-main">My main focus was on the digital - working on designing and building (together with the back end developer) a responsive and a mobile site, as well as digital advertising.</p>
      <p class="p-main">The Brand Story revolved around keeping it clean and fresh and bold. I used a lot of black and white and the branding was quite neutral to place emphasis
			on the clothing.</p>

    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
		<p class="p-main">CEO's idea behind The Idle Man name came from the saying 'idle hands' (meaning that most guys don't really like shopping so much). It was also a platform for a community to learn and follow style trends, so the logo incorporates this
 idea.</p>

    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
			<p class="p-main">My main focus while working on this project was making the website resposive across desktop, tablet and mobile. This implemented mobile friendly and mobile first tactics.</p>
			<p class="p-main">We wanted to avoid hiding the most valuable sections of the site in the hamburger menu based on our user research, and opted for a more accessible list on mobile.</p>

    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
			<p class="p-main">Another focus of this brand was with fashion styling and The Idle Man required a sort of style guide for the user. Working closely with the Marketing
			Director and the style editor, we came up with a style guide questionaire. I designed and built a form that allowed the user to let the stylist know what
		the user likes. This information was used then for the stylist to select a brand new wardrobe for the user. This data was sent out via email, whenere the user
	could buy the outfit directly or just a few pieces. It proved to be successful and helped in generating data on what sort of audience the site was attracting.</p>

    <section class="cd-section cd-container">
			<p class="p-main">I also made sure that all artwork across social media was on brand, providing templates and style guides for other designrs coming on board.</p>
