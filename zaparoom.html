			<p class="p-main"> This was a side projects I worked on with a few friends of mine. It was more of an experiment to see if we could take it to the market and how we could build on it. </p>
			<p class="p-main"> I took the lead with design and research. We mocked up a website and an app. We branded it to look professional and clean, yet approachable and aimed towards a younger audience who might be looking for a room to rent in London. </p>

			<p class="p-main"> We spent about a month on this project and used to meet in the British Library as much as I could fit some time in in between my other freelance work. Although we didn't really attempt to start a new business, it did feel a little like working
			on a little start up.</p>
			<p class="p-main"> We learned some interesting lessons on this project. We spoke to potential developers and business associates to see if we could work on it any further. This project definitely needs a lot more work, but our aim was
			to look for ways to make searching to rent rooms a bit more fun and interesting. </p>
