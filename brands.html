			<p>I love working with story telling and so when working with logo and branding design, that helps me immensely in coming up with ideas. Every idea
			and brand has a story and when it comes to designing logos and identities my aim is to uncover something interesting and quintessential to that brand.</p>

      <p>Wave is a ticketing software. The idea behind the name is to reflect the rush of customers museums for example experience. There are of course
				various kinds of waves: ocean waves, sound waves, electronic waves etc.. A wave can also be controlled, and this is what this software allows the user to do.
		 </p>
		 <p>That tone of light blue was chosen for a calming effect, as it eases the user's workload, but also, this being a tech product, the blue conveys trutworthiness
		 in this case. </p>

      <p>Populi means people in Italian. This little project branded an Italian tech start up where the main focus for them was on people. They worked on
			building software that eased user's workloads, in aim to reduce stress and increase user's time. They also saw their company as a happy place to work.
		Bearing this in mind, I came up with the idea of creating a face from the logo and playing with emoticon inspired graphics.</p>

			<p>Logo design for a luxury brand. They wanted a logo that resembled a tree but still looked elegant and embodied a sense of luxury. I
			worked with curvy shapes and lines to create that sort of intricacy. The colours allude to gold and rich, deep shades you may find in royal households.
		However, not forgetting its natural plant origin, the final product had a green tone in all the colours.</p>
