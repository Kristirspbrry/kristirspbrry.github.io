			<p>I worked with designing an app for iOS on this project. Its main feature was communication between 2 users and a scheduling element.</p>

		<section class="cd-section cd-container">
			<p>When desiging the schedule screen, I aimed to make it easily amendable by the user. Displaying the hour the activity takes place, as well as the address would
			save the user extra hassle. For example, clicking on the address would take the user directly to the map where directions would be easily shown. </p>
			<p>The user can also easily amend or cancel an activity with an edit button nearby, as well as add extra activities.</p>

			<p>Messaging was one of the most important aspect within the app, of which there were 2 kinds - mail and text messaging. These of course differ in design, while
			keeping to the iOS design guidelines.</p>
