			<h2 class="medium-title">Getting Engagement</h2>
			<p class="p-main">We had an objective for the December period to come up with a way to engage users to log into the app daily.</p>
			<p class="p-main">From our user tests and research we found that loyalty to cashback sites is hard to get by and our users are always on the lookout for a better deal.</p>
			<p class="p-main">As a business, we wanted to give back to our users through some kind of gifting experience. We put together a quick workshop to ideate on what we could do. We needed a way to give a digital present but in an engaging way, so we came up with an ineractive game where a user could draw a prize and collect amazon vouchers. </p>
			<p class="p-main">My team for this project involved a PM, Android and iOS developers. Our process was mainly ideation and planning and falling back on data we had already collected. We worked in super quick sprints to test out some ideas and tools before we went ahead with the design and implementation.</p>

      <p class="p-main"> We had a really quick turnaroud to deliver the final product, so I animated everything in After Effects so we could export the jsons straight to developers and save time in any motion dev work. The tools that we used for this project really sped up our process. It was something new that we all learned as a team and had to work together to deliver on time. </p>

		<p class="p-main">Our objective was to get more of our users engaged and our data showed a big increase in users on the app daily compared to last years data. We were also able to target new users on social media and achieved new user sign ups. </p>
		<p class="p-main">We used this quick experiment as an MVP to see whether this is the sort of direction that would work to develop our product towards. </p>
