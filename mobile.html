			<p class="p-main">Our objective of this project was to focus on user research and user journeys and using our data and research to re-design the Android and iOS apps.</p>
			<p class="p-main">The core team for this project included a PM and developers. Also, working with our data team, we gathered data from the data team and our user tests to inform our ideation phase. </p>

		<p class="p-main"> We approached this project with the double diamond framework. The first step for us was to understand our users and how they shop before I could move on working on ideas for the business.</p>
		<p class="p-main"> Learning about how people show and how those who are already using Quidco (I interviewed Quidco users and those who didnâ€™t know much about cashback. I was able to make some overall suggestions on how we can improve user experience throughout our product.</p>

		<p class="p-main">Working closely with the team we examined the data we had on user journeys and what we as a business aimed to achieve with our users to remap some of our flows and structure. </p>
		<p class="p-main">We also tackled some of the issues with UI. I backed up my reasoning with research and another case study. We aimed to improve the product UX and usability with this re-design as well as questioning how we could develop this product further to our users' needs.</p>

		<p class="p-main">Since we have built native first experiences for both apps, the design system did differ a little bit, however, they both have common elements running throughout to ensure consistency of the brand. </p>
		<p class="p-main"> I also have a few more case studies related to this project, but they were also a wider research study for Quidco. </p>
