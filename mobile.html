			<h2 class="medium-title">Quidco</h2>
			<p class="p-main">I worked with Quidco to improve their Android and iPhone mobile apps. Their initial design was very similar, however after some UX research I introduced a more native design to both apps to ease the user experience, while still keeping the Quidco branding.</p>
			<p class="p-main">While tackling the mobile apps I also stepped in as Head of Design for a year for the team, leading 3 other designers and working together with lots of other teams in the company.</p>
      <p class="p-main">During my time at Quidco, I iniated several UX research exercises with helped immensely with the development of the Quidco brand.</p>

		<p class="p-main">Besides working on mobile design, I redesigned the user's dashboard, following my UX research and testing.</p>
		<p class="p-main">Having branched out my design infuence across several fields in the company I also started working closely with Marketing and Acquisition teams on designing the cashback business by introducing more UX in the brand. It's something I really enjoy working with and will write more about in my blog.</p>
